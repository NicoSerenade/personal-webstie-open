# Nicol√°s Casta√±eda - Personal Website

> **"Building technology for human flourishing"**

Welcome to the public repository of my personal website! This code is open source as part of my commitment to transparency, education, and the belief that sharing knowledge accelerates collective progress.

## üåü Why This Code Is Public

**Transparency in Action**: I believe in practicing what I preach. As someone who advocates for technology that serves humanity rather than exploiting it, I want you to see exactly how my digital presence works‚Äîno hidden trackers, no data harvesting, just honest technology.

**Educational Value**: Whether you're a student learning web development, a fellow developer seeking inspiration, or someone curious about how websites work, this code serves as a real-world example of clean, ethical web development.

**Building Trust**: In an era where technology often operates in black boxes, I choose transparency. You can see exactly what happens when you visit my website, how your data is handled (spoiler: it's kept private), and how everything functions.

**Community & Collaboration**: By making this public, I hope to inspire others to build technology with integrity and to foster a community of developers who prioritize human wellbeing over profit.

## üèóÔ∏è How This Website Works (Non-Technical Explanation)

Think of a website like a house. Just as a house has different rooms, decorations, and functionality, a website has different components that work together to create the experience you see.

### üìÑ HTML Files - The House Structure

HTML files are like the **blueprint and structure** of each room in the house:

- **`index.html`** - The front door and main living room (homepage)
- **`about.html`** - The personal study where you learn about me
- **`portfolio.html`** - The gallery showcasing my work
- **`blog.html`** - The library with my writings
- **`contact.html`** - The office where you can reach out
- **`testimonial-form.html`** - The guest book where others share experiences

Each HTML file contains the basic structure: where the title goes, where text appears, where images are placed, and how everything is organized on the page.

### üé® CSS Files - The Interior Design

CSS files are like the **interior designer** of the website:

- **`style.css`** - The main design rules used throughout the house
- **`about.css`** - Special decorations just for the about page
- **`blog.css`** - Unique styling for the blog section
- **`contact-form.css`** - Specific design for contact forms
- **`portfolio.css`** - Gallery-specific styling
- **`testimonials.css`** - Design for the testimonials section

These files determine colors, fonts, spacing, animations, and how everything looks visually. They make the difference between a bare concrete structure and a beautifully designed home.

### ‚ö° JavaScript Files - The Smart Home System

JavaScript files are like the **smart home automation** that makes everything interactive:

- **`script.js`** - The main control system for basic interactions
- **`testimonials.js`** - Manages the testimonials slider and loads reviews from the database
- **`contact-form.js`** - Handles sending messages when you fill out contact forms
- **`blog.js`** - Automatically loads and displays blog posts
- **`latest-post.js`** - Shows the most recent blog post on the homepage

These files make the website dynamic‚Äîthey handle clicks, form submissions, animations, and real-time updates.

### üîÑ The Blog System - The Publishing Workshop

The blog system is like having a **personal publishing workshop**:

1. **Markdown Files** - I write blog posts in simple text format (like writing in a notebook)
2. **Conversion Process** - A system converts these simple files into beautiful web pages
3. **Automatic Integration** - New posts automatically appear on the blog and homepage
4. **SEO Optimization** - Each post is optimized to be found by search engines

### üí¨ The Testimonials System - The Guest Experience Manager

This is like having a **sophisticated guest book system**:

1. **Submission Form** - Visitors can submit testimonials with photos
2. **Cloud Database** - Testimonials are stored securely in Cloudflare's database
3. **Admin Review** - I can approve testimonials before they appear publicly
4. **Automatic Display** - Approved testimonials automatically show up on the homepage

### üì± Responsive Design - The Adaptive Architecture

The website automatically adapts to different screen sizes:
- **Desktop** - Full layout with all features
- **Tablet** - Adjusted layout for medium screens
- **Mobile** - Simplified, touch-friendly design

This is like having furniture that automatically resizes itself depending on who's visiting!

- **Database**: Cloudflare D1 (SQLite-based)
- **Storage**: Cloudflare R2 for images

- **Minimal data collection** - Only collect what's necessary for functionality
- **Transparent processing** - You can see exactly how any submitted data is handled
- **Secure storage** - All data is encrypted and stored securely
